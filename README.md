# Cyberchef

## Overview

This app is made with React, utilizing the latest updates with hooks and the fetch api.

API's used:
* The meal api (https://www.themealdb.com/api.php)
* The cocktail api (https://www.thecocktaildb.com/api.php)

## Functionality

This simple application fetches a random meal from the meal api and a random cocktail from the cocktail api. The aim is to provide users with a care-free idea of what to eat for dinner :)

The interaction with the app is minimized to two buttons, one for each. Extra steps are made with regards to the animations, as this is supposed to be a lightweight and fun experience. Will also work for mobile and most browsers. (Likely not IE)

Note: I made the chef svg and the background by myself in illustrator :)
